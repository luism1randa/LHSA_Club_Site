                <h4>Achieve Success</h4>
                <p>As Latinos we have all lived unique experiences and challenges that other groups have not had to face. Whether it be overcoming the struggles of being first generation college students or lack of access to resources, we have had to overcome large barriers to be successful in such a highly competitive field.</p>
                <p>At LHSA we believe Latino students are in a unique position to become culturally competent healthcare providers as a result of the diverse challenges we have had to overcome. Our goal is to motivate and empower these students.</p>

                <h4>Obtain resources</h4>
                <p>One of the difficulties of being a pre-health student is that there is an extremely long list of requirements to reach the next step in our healthcare careers. Whether it be challenging courses, volunteer hours, extracurricular, or endless exams, the list can be overwhelming.</p>
                <p>We want to provide a one-stop hub to showcase how students can gain access to useful study tools; simplify application processes for volunteer, research, and professional school; and access to unique opportunities.</p>

                <h4>Grow a Community</h4>
                <p>The pre-health field is highly competitive. Students are often busy seeing how they can position themselves to be the best and professional schools encourage us to do everything we can to stand out from our fellow peers. Sometimes its easy to get lost in the sea of expectations and forget that we’re not alone.</p>
                <p>At LHSA we want to provide our members the opportunity to network with all the likeminded students, faculty, and health professionals on campus who know what it’s like to be a part of and thrive in such environment.​</p>

            <div class="team-bio">
                <p>Hola! My name is Gissel Heraldez and I am currently a junior studying physiology in hopes of becoming a doctor one day. I was born and raised in Casa Grande, Arizona, but my parents are from Sinaloa, Mexico. As some of you can probably relate, they came to the states to give my siblings and I opportunities they never had. Having close friends that could also relate made LHSA come alive. We saw the lack of resources offered to Latinx pre-health students as well as a lack of advertisement for the amazing (but few) resources offered and we wanted to make a change. Aside from this, one of our major goals for this club is to provide students with a sense of belonging. We don’t want to push each other down while trying to reach our goals. We want to help each other grow and cheer each other on, like a family.</p>
                
                <p>Now that you have a little more background about the club and how it was founded (it’s a bio, not a mission statement, Gissel…) I know, I know.. I’ll finish with a few facts about my self. On my free time, I enjoy working out, playing my guitar, and singing. I’m definitely not a good singer, but a very passionate one at the very least. I also love dancing my little heart out, so if you see me randomly dancing for no reason, you have my permission to laugh.</p>

                <p>I was born in Obregon Son. Mexico but raised in Tucson Az. Travelling between the two allowed me to observe the differences between urban life and rural life. Seeing the disparities in health and opportunities that often came with such distinct lifestyles encouraged me to give back to my community by volunteering as often as I could.</p>

                <p>I always had a fascination for science and learning about the human body. Naturally, studying medicine was the perfect way to satisfy my curiosity and eagerness to help the less fortunate.</p>

                <p>When I’m not frantically studying for an exam I enjoy hiking and photography. Many trails often make for good photographs that make me look I know what I’m doing (I usually don’t).</p>

                <p>Hey! My name is Anna Maria Driesen and I am a Senior studying Physiology, Public Health, and Spanish. My goal is to apply to Medical School this summer and become a traveling physician working in rural communities all over the world. I was born and raised in Tucson by my dad who works in Rural Public Health, and my mom who is a Guatemalan migrant working as a nurse. I definitely became passionate about medicine and health disparities from my parents and they are the reason I work hard everyday.</p>
                
                <p>LHSA is such an amazing organization because it brings together the Latin community and provides incredible resources. With such a big campus it can be difficult to meet people similar to you or with the same passion. Outside of school you will probably find me at a coffee shop even though I don't like coffee or hiking at sunset!</p>
