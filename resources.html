            <h2>Start Your Journey in Pre-Health</h2>
            <p>As pre-health students you are expected to go above and beyond in demonstrating your abilities and interest in your field. Maintaining good grades, participating in scientific research, and being involved in your community are all excellent ways of demonstrating your passion and commitment.</p>

            <p>However, as fellow pre-health students we know this journey can be daunting. Which is why we have drawn from our experiences, success, and mistakes in order to provide you with the best resources available on campus, locally in Tucson, and online.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that some of our board members have participated in many of these programs previously so feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:lhsa.ua@gmail.com">lhsa.ua@gmail.com</a> or contact one of our <a href="about.html#meet-the-team">board members</a> directly for more information and advice!</p>

In addition to serving Sunday brunch, WORKship volunteers also simultaneously staff a clothing bank, help run an extensive first-aid station, entertain their guests, and whip up over 150 lunch bags for those in need.</p>

                            <p>Here's some of the stuff you might see if you help with the first-aid station:</p>

                            <p>The PreMD Ambassadors program is a unique opportunity that gives undergraduate students interested in medicine, access to incredible resources at the College of Medicine – Tucson. PreMD Ambassadors work with the Admissions Office on a variety of projects, assist with major events, participate in community service and lead tours, while learning indepth skills to prepare them for their own medical school application</p>

                            <p>As a PreMD Ambassador, you will learn about the educational paths that you and your fellow students can take to medical school, and about the programs and opportunities offered by the College of Medicine. The program lasts for a full academic year, during which you'll remain enrolled full-time in your undergraduate major. Each ambassador functions with little supervision. They maintain a high degree of professionalism, reliability, and confidentiality.</p>
